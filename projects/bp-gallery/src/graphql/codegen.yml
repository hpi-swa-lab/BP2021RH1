# Strapi v4 doesn't export a separate schema file anymore, so we need to query the GraphQL-playground ('/graphql') here instead.
# Note that the schema there is only available when the Strapi instance is currently running on the server in development mode.
# In a production version there is no GraphQL-playground. So if we switch to production on the server one day,
# we will need to generate stuff against a local Strapi instance here instead.
